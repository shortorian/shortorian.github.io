<p>I&#8217;m interested in getting some experience with WordPress, so I&#8217;m building this site using the WordPress Gutenberg editor and then exporting a static site to a GitHub repository. This is the first website I&#8217;ve ever made, so it&#8217;s been a bit of a learning process.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using this as a tutorial, skip to the end and read the notes first!</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/">Simply Static</a> is the plugin everyone recommends but I couldn&#8217;t get it to work. I ran into errors I couldn&#8217;t resolve, including a cryptic message that it couldn&#8217;t copy some local files when generating the site and a 301 error on the diagnostics page. I <em>was</em> able to figure out that adding quotes around the path to the local directory where the site should be deployed breaks the generator because it doesn&#8217;t strip the quotes. I am on Windows though and I have a sneaking suspicion Simply Static would work better on linux, but I was too lazy to pull out another machine to try it out.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve settled on <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a> for my local development environment and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/staatic/">Staatic</a> to generate the static site. I also tried <a href="https://localwp.com/">LocalWP</a> for the local server because it&#8217;s very slightly easier to use than xampp, but after an hour playing around with it I couldn&#8217;t get Staatic to deploy a site in that environment. Staatic worked right out of the box for me, which was refreshing after my experience with Simply Static.</p>



<h4>Set up the development environment</h4>



<ol style="line-height:1.5"><li>Install <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a>. Uncheck the box to open the control panel after the install, because it&#8217;ll throw irritating errors when closing the control panel when it runs without admin rights.</li><li>Download <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress</a>. Extract the <code>wordpress</code> directory from the zip file and put it in <code>&lt;xampp install directory&gt;/htdocs/</code></li><li>Open the xampp control panel as administrator, check the boxes for Apache and MySQL in the Service column if they aren&#8217;t greyed out, then start them.</li><li>Open your browser and go to <code>localhost/phpmyadmin</code> (or click on phpMyAdmin at the top right of the Dashboard page if you got there).</li><li>Click on Databases in the toolbar at the top. In the Create database box, make up a name, select Collation at the top of the dropdown menu, and click Create. It doesn&#8217;t matter what the name is and we don&#8217;t have to configure permissions because we&#8217;re going to deploy a static site at the end.</li></ol>



<h4>Configure WordPress</h4>



<ol><li>Open a browser tab and go to <code>localhost/wordpress</code>. Follow the dialogues to create a new wordpress deployment using the name of the database you just created. The database credentials are username <code>root</code> and a blank password.</li><li>Log in at <code>localhost/wordpress</code> with whatever administrator user credentials you just created.</li><li>Go to the Plugins tab on the left hand sidebar, check boxes for anything that&#8217;s installed and bulk delete them. Click the &#8220;add new&#8221; button at the top and install Staatic.</li><li>Go to the Settings page for Staatic. Select Offline for the Destination URL (you&#8217;ll change this when you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site).</li><li><strong>You have to click Save Changes at the bottom of every settings page. </strong></li><li>On the Deployment tab of the Staatic settings page, select Local Directory from the dropdown menu and give it the path to the local directory where you&#8217;re syncing the repository for your GitHub site. In the text box for Retain Files/Directories, add lines for <code>.git</code> and anything else you want to live in the repository aside from the website files (like <code>readme.md</code>).</li><li>Go to the Publications page under the Staatic tab on the sidebar and click the Publish Now button at the top. If everything is working, you should be able to access a local version of the sample website via <code>index.html</code> in the directory for your GitHub repository.</li></ol>



<p>When you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site online, go back to the Staatic plugin Settings page. Under the Build tab, change the Destination URL to <code>/</code> or the URL for your GitHub pages site, publish the site again from the Staatic Publications page, and commit the changes to your repository. There&#8217;s a GitHub actions script that has to run after each commit before the page is live, but it should be available in tens of seconds.</p>



<h4>A few notes for people who want to try this for themselves</h4>



<p><strong>You can&#8217;t build a full-featured WordPress site this way.</strong> If you aren&#8217;t familiar with WordPress, it&#8217;s partly designed to make complex products like comments sections and online storefronts easy to deploy. None of that is possible on static sites, which is what GitHub hosts for free.</p>



<p><strong>I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ve set up a GitHub site already.</strong> See the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">official tutorial</a> for instructions.</p>



<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know how well WordPress themes work as static sites.</strong> I imagine simple ones are fine, but I don&#8217;t know if you can do things like frames or animated transitions on static sites. Even if you can, they might not be implemented in WordPress in a way that&#8217;s compatible with static site generation. If you&#8217;re interested in downloading a third-party theme, you should deploy the theme sample site to GitHub and make sure you can use all the features you want on the live site before investing more time.</p>
