I participated in this work as an intern and then a master's student with the TITAN group at TRIUMF, Canada's national lab for nuclear and particle physics. TITAN is a collaboration which centers on a Penning Trap designed for extremely high precision nuclear mass measurements. The precise mass of a nucleus is an important input for theorists studying fundamental interactions and nuclear structure as well as astrophysicists studying things like supernovae and neutron star mergers.

During my internship I traveled to the University of Giessen in Germany and worked with the IONAS group to construct a new atomic mass spectrometer that would function both as an isobar separator (a very sensitive filter for sample preparation) and as a new tool to acquire very rapid but less precise mass spectra. At the end of my internship I returned to Vancouver and continued commissioning the new spectrometer at TRIUMF as a master's student.
