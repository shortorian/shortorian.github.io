excerpt: "Nuclear mass values are an important experimental input for research in nuclear theory, astrophysics, and fundamental symmetries. Penning trap experiments such as TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) have produced the most precise mass values available for many exotic nuclei. TITAN has recently installed a multiple reflection time of flight (MR-ToF) mass separator to isolate rare isotopes for mass measurements even when they are obscured by intense isobaric backgrounds."

This is my master's thesis reporting on work I did as an intern and then a graduate student with the TITAN group at TRIUMF, Canada's national lab for nuclear and particle physics. TITAN is a collaboration which centers on a Penning Trap designed for extremely high precision nuclear mass measurements. The precise mass of a nucleus is an important input for theorists studying fundamental interactions and nuclear structure as well as astrophysicists studying things like supernovae and neutron star mergers.

During my internship I traveled to the University of Giessen in Germany and worked with the IONAS group to construct a new atomic mass spectrometer that would function both as an isobar separator (a very sensitive filter for sample preparation) and as a new tool to acquire very rapid but less precise mass spectra. At the end of my internship I returned to Vancouver and continued commissioning the new spectrometer at TRIUMF as a master's student.
