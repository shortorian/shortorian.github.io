I participated in this work as a master's student with the TITAN group at TRIUMF, Canada's national lab for nuclear and particle physics. TITAN is a collaboration which centers on a Penning Trap designed for extremely high precision nuclear mass measurements. The precise mass of a nucleus is an important input for theorists studying fundamental interactions and nuclear structure as well as astrophysicists studying things like supernovae and neutron star mergers.
