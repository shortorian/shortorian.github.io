excerpt: 'A precision mass investigation of the neutron-rich titanium isotopes <sup>51−55</sup>Ti was performed at TRIUMF’s Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN). The range of the measurements covers the <i>N</i>=32 shell closure, and the overall uncertainties of the <sup>52−55</sup>Ti mass values were significantly reduced.'

I participated in this work as a master's student with the TITAN group at TRIUMF, Canada's national lab for nuclear and particle physics. TITAN is a collaboration which centers on a Penning Trap designed for extremely high precision nuclear mass measurements. The precise mass of a nucleus is an important input for theorists studying fundamental interactions and nuclear structure as well as astrophysicists studying things like supernovae and neutron star mergers.
