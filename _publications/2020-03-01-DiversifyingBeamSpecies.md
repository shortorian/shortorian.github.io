excerpt: "Recapturing the recoiling daughters from radioactive decay can be a simple way to diversify beam availability at rare isotope beam facilities. In the decay and recapture ion trapping (DRIT) technique, a parent species is stored in an ion trap and left to decay, and the daughter ions are recaptured by the trap and become available for use. We successfully demonstrated the technique using the electron beam ion trap (EBIT) at the TITAN facility."

I participated in this work as a master's student with the TITAN group at TRIUMF, Canada's national lab for nuclear and particle physics. TITAN is a collaboration which centers on a Penning Trap designed for extremely high precision nuclear mass measurements. The precise mass of a nucleus is an important input for theorists studying fundamental interactions and nuclear structure as well as astrophysicists studying things like supernovae and neutron star mergers.
