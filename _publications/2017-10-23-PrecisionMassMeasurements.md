title: "Precision mass measurements of <sup>125-127</sup>Cd isotopes and isomers approaching the <i>N</i>=82 closed shell"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-10-23-PrecisionMassMeasurements
excerpt: 'We present the results of precision mass measurements of neutron-rich cadmium isotopes. These nuclei approach the <i>N</i>=82 closed neutron shell and are important to nuclear structure as they lie near doubly magic <sup>132</sup>Sn on the chart of nuclides.'

I participated in this work as a master's student with the TITAN group at TRIUMF, Canada's national lab for nuclear and particle physics. TITAN is a collaboration which centers on a Penning Trap designed for extremely high precision nuclear mass measurements. The precise mass of a nucleus is an important input for theorists studying fundamental interactions and nuclear structure as well as astrophysicists studying things like supernovae and neutron star mergers.
