<p>I made this poster as part of my master&#8217;s degree in nuclear science at Simon Fraser University. I worked at TRIUMF, Canada&#8217;s National Lab for Nuclear and Particle Physics, in the TITAN group, which specializes in extremely high precision measurements of the mass of radioactive atoms. These measurements help physicists learn more about nuclear structure and also provide important constraints on astronomers&#8217; theories about the evolution of stars. I helped develop a new spectrometer that could act as a filter for the TITAN setup, allowing access to many new nuclei by removing contaminants TRIUMF couldn&#8217;t process at the time. Our device, called a multiple reflection time of flight mass spectrometer, also allowed TRIUMF accelerator scientists to directly monitor the full contents of their radioactive ion beams (including stable components rather than just radioactive isotopes) for the first time.</p>



<p>This was the third scientific poster I made, and I think I did a fairly good job on it. The biggest problem is that there aren&#8217;t any immediate messages you can get walking by (or from the small image below). The summary section should get replaced with two or three main points that get a message across to people who don&#8217;t come close enough to see the rest of the poster.</p>

<p>I made the poster below as part of an internship at Berkeley National Lab in 2010. I worked with a group that did ultrafast pump-probe laser spectroscopy for materials science. In these studies, chains of extremely short laser pulses are used to &#8220;pump&#8221; a sample, changing its state, and then probe changes in the sample after excitation with the pump. These techniques are used to study exotic material properties like superconductivity. During the internship I designed an instrument called an optical parametric amplifier, which allows an operator to tune the center frequency of the ultrafast pulses in order to pump states of interest for experiments.</p>



<p>This was my first research poster and largely demonstrates all the things you shouldn&#8217;t do &#8211; it has tons of text, doesn&#8217;t use figures well, and it&#8217;s mostly copied out of the final written report for the internship. Some symbols in this copy are also a bit garbled after importing a PDF to Inkscape and then exporting a PNG, but hopefully no one&#8217;s looking that closely&#8230;</p>

<p>I made this conference poster in 2011 as part of an ongoing research project meant to check the Conservation of the Vector Current hypothesis (CVC), a theory in the Standard Model. CVC says, among other things, that some nuclei should decay in different ways equally often, but previous work indicated that a certain excited state of Sodium 22 might have decay modes that break CVC. I assisted in each phase of this experiment, from design to analysis, including building a beamline and operating the accelerator at the University of Washington nuclear physics lab.</p>



<p>This was my second scientific poster. I&#8217;d improved a bit from the first, but there&#8217;s still a long way to go: lots of text and no clear message at first sight. I was presenting at a nuclear physics conference and it got high praise from at least one attendee, but it&#8217;s obviously extremely dense for everyone else!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in getting some experience with WordPress, so I&#8217;m building this site using the WordPress Gutenberg editor and then exporting a static site to a GitHub repository. This is the first website I&#8217;ve ever made, so it&#8217;s been a bit of a learning process.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far.</p>
</div>

<p>If you&#8217;re using this as a tutorial, skip to the end and read the notes first!</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/">Simply Static</a> is the plugin everyone recommends but I couldn&#8217;t get it to work. I ran into errors I couldn&#8217;t resolve, including a cryptic message that it couldn&#8217;t copy some local files when generating the site and a 301 error on the diagnostics page. I <em>was</em> able to figure out that adding quotes around the path to the local directory where the site should be deployed breaks the generator because it doesn&#8217;t strip the quotes. I am on Windows though and I have a sneaking suspicion Simply Static would work better on linux, but I was too lazy to pull out another machine to try it out.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve settled on <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a> for my local development environment and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/staatic/">Staatic</a> to generate the static site. I also tried <a href="https://localwp.com/">LocalWP</a> for the local server because it&#8217;s very slightly easier to use than xampp, but after an hour playing around with it I couldn&#8217;t get Staatic to deploy a site in that environment. Staatic worked right out of the box for me, which was refreshing after my experience with Simply Static.</p>



<h4>Set up the development environment</h4>



<ol style="line-height:1.5"><li>Install <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a>. Uncheck the box to open the control panel after the install, because it&#8217;ll throw irritating errors when closing the control panel when it runs without admin rights.</li><li>Download <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress</a>. Extract the <code>wordpress</code> directory from the zip file and put it in <code>&lt;xampp install directory&gt;/htdocs/</code></li><li>Open the xampp control panel as administrator, check the boxes for Apache and MySQL in the Service column if they aren&#8217;t greyed out, then start them.</li><li>Open your browser and go to <code>localhost/phpmyadmin</code> (or click on phpMyAdmin at the top right of the Dashboard page if you got there).</li><li>Click on Databases in the toolbar at the top. In the Create database box, make up a name, select Collation at the top of the dropdown menu, and click Create. It doesn&#8217;t matter what the name is and we don&#8217;t have to configure permissions because we&#8217;re going to deploy a static site at the end.</li></ol>



<h4>Configure WordPress</h4>



<ol><li>Open a browser tab and go to <code>localhost/wordpress</code>. Follow the dialogues to create a new wordpress deployment using the name of the database you just created. The database credentials are username <code>root</code> and a blank password.</li><li>Log in at <code>localhost/wordpress</code> with whatever administrator user credentials you just created.</li><li>Go to the Plugins tab on the left hand sidebar, check boxes for anything that&#8217;s installed and bulk delete them. Click the &#8220;add new&#8221; button at the top and install Staatic.</li><li>Go to the Settings page for Staatic. Select Offline for the Destination URL (you&#8217;ll change this when you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site).</li><li><strong>You have to click Save Changes at the bottom of every settings page. </strong></li><li>On the Deployment tab of the Staatic settings page, select Local Directory from the dropdown menu and give it the path to the local directory where you&#8217;re syncing the repository for your GitHub site. In the text box for Retain Files/Directories, add lines for <code>.git</code> and anything else you want to live in the repository aside from the website files (like <code>readme.md</code>).</li><li>Go to the Publications page under the Staatic tab on the sidebar and click the Publish Now button at the top. If everything is working, you should be able to access a local version of the sample website via <code>index.html</code> in the directory for your GitHub repository.</li></ol>



<p>When you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site online, go back to the Staatic plugin Settings page. Under the Build tab, change the Destination URL to <code>/</code> or the URL for your GitHub pages site, publish the site again from the Staatic Publications page, and commit the changes to your repository. There&#8217;s a GitHub actions script that has to run after each commit before the page is live, but it should be available in tens of seconds.</p>



<h4>A few notes for people who want to try this for themselves</h4>



<p><strong>You can&#8217;t build a full-featured WordPress site this way.</strong> If you aren&#8217;t familiar with WordPress, it&#8217;s partly designed to make complex products like comments sections and online storefronts easy to deploy. None of that is possible on static sites, which is what GitHub hosts for free.</p>



<p><strong>I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ve set up a GitHub site already.</strong> See the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">official tutorial</a> for instructions.</p>



<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know how well WordPress themes work as static sites.</strong> I imagine simple ones are fine, but I don&#8217;t know if you can do things like frames or animated transitions on static sites. Even if you can, they might not be implemented in WordPress in a way that&#8217;s compatible with static site generation. If you&#8217;re interested in downloading a third-party theme, you should deploy the theme sample site to GitHub and make sure you can use all the features you want on the live site before investing more time.</p>
