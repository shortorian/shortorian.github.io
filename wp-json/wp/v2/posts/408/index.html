I worked with a group that did ultrafast pump-probe laser spectroscopy for materials science. In these studies, chains of extremely short laser pulses are used to &#8220;pump&#8221; a sample, changing its state, and then probe changes in the sample after excitation with the pump. These techniques are used to study exotic material properties like superconductivity. During the internship I designed an instrument called an optical parametric amplifier, which allows an operator to tune the center frequency of the ultrafast pulses in order to pump states of interest for experiments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my first research poster and largely demonstrates all the things you shouldn&#8217;t do &#8211; it has tons of text, doesn&#8217;t use figures well, and it&#8217;s mostly copied out of the final written report for the internship. Some symbols in this copy are also a bit garbled after importing a PDF to Inkscape and then exporting a PNG, but hopefully no one&#8217;s looking that closely&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"757\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_suli_2010_poster-1024x757.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-411\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_suli_2010_poster-1024x757.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_suli_2010_poster-300x222.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_suli_2010_poster-768x568.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_suli_2010_poster-1536x1136.png 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_suli_2010_poster-2048x1515.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I made the poster below as part of an internship at Berkeley National Lab in 2010.
