I worked at TRIUMF, Canada&#8217;s National Lab for Nuclear and Particle Physics, in the TITAN group, which specializes in extremely high precision measurements of the mass of radioactive atoms. These measurements help physicists learn more about nuclear structure and also provide important constraints on astronomers&#8217; theories about the evolution of stars. I helped develop a new spectrometer that could act as a filter for the TITAN setup, allowing access to many new nuclei by removing contaminants TRIUMF couldn&#8217;t process at the time. Our device, called a multiple reflection time of flight mass spectrometer, also allowed TRIUMF accelerator scientists to directly monitor the full contents of their radioactive ion beams (including stable components rather than just radioactive isotopes) for the first time. I report on this project in much more detail in my <a href=\"https:\/\/summit.sfu.ca\/item\/18495\">master&#8217;s thesis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the third scientific poster I made, and I think I did a fairly good job on it. The biggest problem is that there aren&#8217;t any immediate messages you can get walking by (or from the small image below). The summary section should get replaced with two or three main points that get a message across to people who don&#8217;t come close enough to see the rest of the poster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"763\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster-1024x763.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster-1024x763.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster-300x223.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster-768x572.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster-1536x1144.png 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster-2048x1525.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_mrtof_2014_poster.pdf\">Click here<\/a> for a PDF.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I made this poster as part of my master&#8217;s degree in nuclear science at Simon Fraser University.
