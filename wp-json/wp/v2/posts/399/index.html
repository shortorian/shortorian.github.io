CVC says, among other things, that some nuclei should decay in different ways equally often, but previous work indicated that a certain excited state of Sodium 22 might have decay modes that break CVC. I assisted in each phase of this experiment, from design to analysis, including building a beamline and operating the accelerator at the University of Washington nuclear physics lab.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my second scientific poster. I&#8217;d improved a bit from the first, but there&#8217;s still a long way to go: lots of text and no clear message at first sight. I was presenting at a nuclear physics conference and it got high praise from at least one attendee, but it&#8217;s obviously extremely dense for everyone else!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"771\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster-1024x771.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster-1024x771.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster-300x226.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster-768x578.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster-1536x1156.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster-2048x1541.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/dshort_ceu_2011_poster.pdf\">Click here<\/a> for a full-size PDF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prc\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevC.95.035501\">The paper on this work<\/a> found that our experiment didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility that the CVC hypothesis is broken but further work would be required to explain the discrepancy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I made this conference poster in 2011 as part of an ongoing research project meant to check the Conservation of the Vector Current hypothesis (CVC), a theory in the Standard Model.
