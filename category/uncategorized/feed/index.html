<p>I live in Seattle so I&#8217;ve become increasingly familiar with the effect of wildfires in recent years. In the last few days, though, the air quality has been as bad as I&#8217;ve ever experienced. This map reflects the Air Quality Index around the Salish Sea, as reported by the <a href="http://map.pscleanair.gov/?lat=47.70560307&amp;lon=-122.53601074&amp;z=10">Puget Sound Clean Air Agency</a>. But there are other sources for AQI data. PurpleAir manufactures consumer air quality sensors that transmit data to their global network, and they provide a <a href="https://map.purpleair.com/1/i/lb/mPM25/a30/p604800/cC4#7.59/47.733/-122.796">public map</a> of the result. There&#8217;s a problem, though: the PurpleAir numbers don&#8217;t agree with the Puget Sound Clean Air data. I&#8217;ve been uncertain about this in past years, but after a few conversations recently I decided to look into it more carefully.</p>
</div></div>



<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#Computing_the_AQI" target="_blank">AQI is defined</a>&nbsp;differently for different pollutants. We&#8217;re mostly looking at PM2.5 for health effects of distant wildfires, and an Air Quality Index of 50 (the top of the &#8220;good&#8221; category) corresponds to 12 ug/m3 of PM2.5,&nbsp;which is just the mass of stuff bigger than 2.5 microns floating in a cubic meter of air. The AQI is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA also defines what are called Federal Reference Methods to measure things like AQI as well as Federal Equivalent Methods, which name products that have been shown to work as well or better than the reference method.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-50/appendix-Appendix%20L%20to%20Part%2050" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FRM for PM2.5 pollution</a>&nbsp;is to weigh very precisely a filter that catches nearly everything bigger than 2.5 um, run a constant controlled flow of air through it for 24 hours, then weigh the filter again. The average particle concentration for the flowing&nbsp;air in the last 24 hours is then the mass of new stuff in the filter divided by the flow rate of the air times 24 hours. That&#8217;s a simple method that&#8217;s pretty easy for anyone with a lab and money to do really precisely. The idea with an FRM is that people will use it to prove to the feds they can consistently build a device that works as well or better than the reference method, the EPA will write a rule in the Federal Register that says the new device is a Federal Equivalent Method for measuring PM2.5 pollution, and then scientists and courts and engineers can trust numbers from manufactured devices without the fed having to build a factory.</p>



<p>EPA and state environmental agencies have other rules, in accordance with the Clean Air Act, that require local governments to operate air pollution monitoring stations. The 2021 revision of the Washington State quality assurance plan for their regulatory air quality monitoring network is&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/publications/documents/99201.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">available here</a>. Among other things, that plan documents what kinds of instruments regulatory air monitoring stations operate in Washington, and there are a lot of them. Page 53 says each station operates at least two kinds of PM2.5 monitors that are both approved as Federal Equivalents: a continuous monitor, which shines a radiation source (either light or betas) on a detector and estimates very quickly how much stuff gets in the way, and a filter-based monitor that works more like the reference method with a longer sampling period. It&#8217;s reasonable to assume the regulatory stations have a good estimate of actual particulate concentrations because every regulatory&nbsp;monitoring station in Washington has an FEM continuous monitor sitting next to a much simpler FEM filter-based monitor and they&#8217;re both run by the same trained operator. There&#8217;s also one station in the state that operates the state monitors alongside a monitor that works on the same method as the &#8220;FEM primary monitor,&#8221; which I assume is a federally operated monitor that provides a comparison between the federal and state reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency implements the state monitoring policy in this region, so when they say the PurpleAir network data is &#8220;uncalibrated&#8221; they mean the PA sensors aren&#8217;t Federal Equivalents. You could calibrate one by taking it to a regulatory monitoring station and letting it run long enough to figure out what correction is required to make that sensor read the same as a regulatory monitor, but the only agreed-upon way to have confidence in all of them is for PA to go to EPA and get a product approved as an FEM. But the PA monitors are so reliable that PSCAA can apply an automatic correction and report the PA network data alongside the regulatory monitors on its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://map.pscleanair.gov/?lat=47.86845909&amp;lon=-122.52612311&amp;z=9" target="_blank">public map</a>&nbsp;(regulatory stations are stars, PA sensors are circles). PSCAA is confident in the PA sensors because people operating precision monitors have been reporting on consumer sensors for a while.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231019305850" target="_blank">This&nbsp;journal article</a>&nbsp;says a set of three PA monitors were more consistent with each other than sets of monitors from other manufacturers, but the PA devices reported values systematically higher than an FEM monitor when PM2.5 density was above 13ug/m3 (which is everything worse than the best AQI category).&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34504625/" target="_blank">This&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;on a national study of PA monitors found they were reliable and that the best estimate of particulate concentration was half the PA value plus a small correction for relative humidity, and discussed a variety of other corrections regulators had considered for PA data.</p>



<p>PS, for some reason I can&#8217;t resist adding that most home smoke detectors are continuous monitors that use alphas to detect particulates, so we&#8217;ve all got little bits of radioactive metal at home. Totally safe, just don&#8217;t eat a lot of them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested in getting some experience with WordPress, so I&#8217;m building this site using the WordPress Gutenberg editor and then exporting a static site to a GitHub repository. This is the first website I&#8217;ve ever made, so it&#8217;s been a bit of a learning process.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far.</p>
</div>

<div class="wp-container-3 wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:10%"></div>

<p>If you&#8217;re using this as a tutorial, skip to the end and read the notes first!</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/">Simply Static</a> is the plugin everyone recommends but I couldn&#8217;t get it to work. I ran into errors I couldn&#8217;t resolve, including a cryptic message that it couldn&#8217;t copy some local files when generating the site and a 301 error on the diagnostics page. I <em>was</em> able to figure out that adding quotes around the path to the local directory where the site should be deployed breaks the generator because it doesn&#8217;t strip the quotes. I am on Windows though and I have a sneaking suspicion Simply Static would work better on linux, but I was too lazy to pull out another machine to try it out.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve settled on <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a> for my local development environment and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/staatic/">Staatic</a> to generate the static site. I also tried <a href="https://localwp.com/">LocalWP</a> for the local server because it&#8217;s very slightly easier to use than xampp, but after an hour playing around with it I couldn&#8217;t get Staatic to deploy a site in that environment. Staatic worked right out of the box for me, which was refreshing after my experience with Simply Static.</p>



<h4>Set up the development environment</h4>



<ol style="line-height:1.5"><li>Install <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a>. Uncheck the box to open the control panel after the install, because it&#8217;ll throw irritating errors when closing the control panel when it runs without admin rights.</li><li>Download <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress</a>. Extract the <code>wordpress</code> directory from the zip file and put it in <code>&lt;xampp install directory&gt;/htdocs/</code></li><li>Open the xampp control panel as administrator, check the boxes for Apache and MySQL in the Service column if they aren&#8217;t greyed out, then start them.</li><li>Open your browser and go to <code>localhost/phpmyadmin</code> (or click on phpMyAdmin at the top right of the Dashboard page if you got there).</li><li>Click on Databases in the toolbar at the top. In the Create database box, make up a name, select Collation at the top of the dropdown menu, and click Create. It doesn&#8217;t matter what the name is and we don&#8217;t have to configure permissions because we&#8217;re going to deploy a static site at the end.</li></ol>



<h4>Configure WordPress</h4>



<ol><li>Open a browser tab and go to <code>localhost/wordpress</code>. Follow the dialogues to create a new wordpress deployment using the name of the database you just created. The database credentials are username <code>root</code> and a blank password.</li><li>Log in at <code>localhost/wordpress</code> with whatever administrator user credentials you just created.</li><li>Go to the Plugins tab on the left hand sidebar, check boxes for anything that&#8217;s installed and bulk delete them. Click the &#8220;add new&#8221; button at the top and install Staatic.</li><li>Go to the Settings page for Staatic. Select Offline for the Destination URL (you&#8217;ll change this when you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site).</li><li><strong>You have to click Save Changes at the bottom of every settings page. </strong></li><li>On the Deployment tab of the Staatic settings page, select Local Directory from the dropdown menu and give it the path to the local directory where you&#8217;re syncing the repository for your GitHub site. In the text box for Retain Files/Directories, add lines for <code>.git</code> and anything else you want to live in the repository aside from the website files (like <code>readme.md</code>).</li><li>Go to the Publications page under the Staatic tab on the sidebar and click the Publish Now button at the top. If everything is working, you should be able to access a local version of the sample website via <code>index.html</code> in the directory for your GitHub repository.</li></ol>



<p>When you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site online, go back to the Staatic plugin Settings page. Under the Build tab, change the Destination URL to <code>/</code> or the URL for your GitHub pages site, publish the site again from the Staatic Publications page, and commit the changes to your repository. There&#8217;s a GitHub actions script that has to run after each commit before the page is live, but it should be available in tens of seconds.</p>



<h4>A few notes for people who want to try this for themselves</h4>



<p><strong>You can&#8217;t build a full-featured WordPress site this way.</strong> If you aren&#8217;t familiar with WordPress, it&#8217;s partly designed to make complex products like comments sections and online storefronts easy to deploy. None of that is possible on static sites, which is what GitHub hosts for free.</p>



<p><strong>I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ve set up a GitHub site already.</strong> See the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">official tutorial</a> for instructions.</p>



<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know how well WordPress themes work as static sites.</strong> I imagine simple ones are fine, but I don&#8217;t know if you can do things like frames or animated transitions on static sites. Even if you can, they might not be implemented in WordPress in a way that&#8217;s compatible with static site generation. If you&#8217;re interested in downloading a third-party theme, you should deploy the theme sample site to GitHub and make sure you can use all the features you want on the live site before investing more time.</p>
